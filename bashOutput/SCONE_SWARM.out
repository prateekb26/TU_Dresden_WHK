To list the nodes of the swarm managed by host **alice**, execute


#### Environment Variable

In case you mainly work with one swarm, you can set environment variable **SCONE_MANAGER**. If option **--manager** is not specified and **SCONE_MANAGER** is defined, the value stored in **SCONE_MANAGER**  is used as the name of the manager.

**Example:** To list all nodes of a swarm managed by host **faye**:


### scone swarm check

**scone** stores the attributes of a node using Docker: the attributes of a node are stored as node **labels**. For example, the attributes if a node supports SGX (**SGX VERSION**), if the patched docker engine (**DOCKER-ENGINE**) and the patched Intel driver (**SGX-DRIVER**) is installed are all stored as labels. 

Attributes might change over time. After a node departs from a swarm or when a node joins a swarm, we need to update the labels. Otherwise, the Docker scheduler might not properly schedule containers on the nodes of a swarm. Also, when nodes of a swarm are listed, warnings might be issued.

To check and update the labels of the swarm nodes, you can execute command **scone swarm check**. You must specify the manager of the swarm by defining option **--manager MANAGER** or by defining environment variable **SCONE_MANAGER**.

**Example:** To check the labels of the swarm managed by node **faye**, execute:



### General options

- **--help** (or, **-h**): issue help message for object **host*. If a command is specified, it issues a help message specific to this command.

- **--debug** (or, **-x**): display all commands that are executed by **scone host**. This can be helpful in case commands fail. When you submit a support request regarding a failed command, please send a copy of the output of the failing command with **--debug** set.

- **--verbose** (or, **-v**): display all commands that are executed by **scone host**. This can be helpful in case commands fail. When you submit a support request regarding a failed command, please send a copy of the log of the output that includes
