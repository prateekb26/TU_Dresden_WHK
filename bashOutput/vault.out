Now, run the benchmark to test if SCONE Vault is setting up the configuration for Nginx.


## Integration with SCONE CAS

For added security, we recommend the following to run Vault in a **release enclave** to prevent attackers from dumping the content of the Vault enclave and to integrate the execution of Vault with SCONE CAS such that:

- the command line arguments and environment variables are passed to Vault in an encrypted fashion

- stdin/stdout/stderr of Vault are encrypted

- CAS can pass a TLS private / public key to Vault

- the Vault encryption key can be stored by SCONE CAS

- Vault's HSM PIN pin can be specified by the VAULT_HSM_PIN environment variable. We can securely set the environment variable with the help of SCONE CAS since SCONE can pass encrypted environment variables to applications.

Please contact us, if you are interested in a setup together with SCONE CAS.
