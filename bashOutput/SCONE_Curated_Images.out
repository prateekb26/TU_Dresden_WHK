before you will be able to pull any of the private curated images.

# Scone Compilers

To run a local copy of the SCONE (cross-)compilers, just pull the appropriate image on your computer.

## Dynamically-Linked Binaries

Even if you have no SGX CPU extension / no SGX driver installed on your computer,
you can use a standard gcc compiler - as long as the requirements mentioned in [SGX ToolChain](SCONE_toolchain.md) are satisfied.


 Note that the binaries generated with the above image are just native binaries, i.e., they run **outside of enclaves**. To be able to run the binary inside of an enclave, you need to have installed the SCONE runtime library.

To run a dynamically-linked binary, one needs a special runtime environment. We provide this in form of a (private) container image:


## Statically-Linked Binaries

To generate statically-linked secure binaries you need a cross compiler. You can pull
this image from Docker hub (you need to be granted access rights for that):


# Scone Hello World

You can pull the following (private) image. This image only runs in hardware mode:


If you installed the patched Docker engine (see [SCONE Host Setup](SCONE_HOST_SETUP.md)), run the **helloworld** program inside of an enclave via


This command will fail in case you have the standard Docker engine installed:



You can run on the standard Docker engine - if you have the SGX driver installed:


If you do not have the SGX driver installed, you get an error message:


In this case, install the SGX driver and the patched Docker engine as described in
[SCONE Host Setup](SCONE_HOST_SETUP.md). This installation will fail in case you disabled SGX in the BIOS or your CPU is not SGX-enabled.
