## Check if the SGX driver is installed

Note that in systems in which the CPU supports SGX but the BIOS disables SGX, the driver might
successfully install and load but using the SGX driver fails. 
Check on the host as well as inside your containers that the SGX device */dev/isgx* is visible:


## Checking availability of SGX device inside of containers

Docker does not automatically map the SGX device inside of containers.
We provide, however, a patched Docker engine and a patched SGX driver that together permit to automatically map the sgx device inside of containers.

You can run the checks to see if the SGX device gets mapped automatically into a container, i.e., if you run the patched docker engine.


If the SGX device is not automatically mapped into the container, you can try to map the device as follows into the container:


In the unlikely case that the device is not mapped in the container, you can try to see if
the container must be privileged or if we might need to remap the device ids:


Use the first alternative that works in your installation to give containers access to the SGX device.
