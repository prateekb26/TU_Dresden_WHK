If you need some help, just execute in the container:


## Example
Let's try to compile a simple program:


We compile the program with **scone gcc** or **scone-gcc** or just **gcc** (all equivalent):


To compute fib(23), execute:


The last line of the output should look as follows:

fib(23)= 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657

## Debugging

You can use **scone-gdb** to debug your applications when running inside of an enclave. For some more details
on how to use the debugger, please read how to [debug GO](GO/#debugging) programs.
